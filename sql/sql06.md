# Intro to SQL and relational databases

## 6. Exercises

Before proceeding to more advanced possibilities, such as defining triggers
and functions, let's practice what we have used so far.

Note: this part will not take 10 minutes of your time... most of the exercises 
might take more than 10 minutes... each. In fact, the last ones may take much 
more...


#### Exercise 6.1: Exercises  ;-)

Create a database with only one table to store info about the exercises you are 
doing in this tutorial. For each exercise, you will store an id (which will be 
used as primary key), the description, the difficulty level (1 to 5), the date 
in which it was proposed and the date in which you solved it.

First draw the entity-relationship diagram. Then create the database and the 
table. Add data for 3 exercises, two of which will not be solved yet. Finally:

- Display all the exercises, sorted by description.

- Display the exercises which contain the word "entity" in its description,
sorted by date proposed (descending).

- Display the id, date proposed and the 50 (or less) first chars of the 
description, for the exercises which have not been solved yet.

- Display the amount of exercises for each difficulty level.
